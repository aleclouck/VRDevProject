# VRDevProject
A simple project Iâ€™ve been working on for the past few days
Works with an HTC Vive headset
You can hit the ball around with the left controller and grab the ball with the right controller by holding the trigger and throw the ball. Pressing up on the right touch pad should reset the position of the ball.
